I sit behind bars in a damp dungeon.
A young eagle, raised in captivity,
My sad comrade, flapping his wing,
Pecks at bloody food under the window,
Pecks, and throws, and looks out the window,
As if he had the same plan as me.
Calls me with his gaze and cry
And wants to say: "Let's fly away!
We are free birds; it's time, brother, it's time!
There, where the mountain turns white behind the cloud,
There, where the sea edges turn blue,
There, where only the wind and I walk!..
